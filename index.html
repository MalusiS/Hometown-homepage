            <h3>1. Table Mountain</h3>

            <div class="to-do-list">

                <div class="list-text">

                    <p>Most definitely the defining beacon of Cape Town's cityscape, Table Mountain is in 
                        fact one of the most instantly recognisable landmarks in the world. On 11 November 
                        2011, Table Mountain was named one of the New7Wonders (N7W) of Nature.</p>
                    <p>Table Mountain has attracted more than 25 million visitors since it opened as a 
                        tourist attraction in 1929. Plateauing at over 1 000 metres above sea level, the 
                        360-degree views of the city, Table Bay, and the rest of the Table Mountain National 
                        Park are definitely a sight to behold.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to magnificent scenery - Cape Town and the surrounding province of the 
                        Western Cape never fails to deliver. With such a varying landscape - found in very few 
                        other places across the globe - Cape Town offers forests, beaches, gardens, mountains, 
                        oceans, grasslands, nature reserves, Winelands, as well as one of the most unique 
                        floral biomes in the world - fynbos.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of fynbos, don't forget to check out the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens along 
                        our Mini Peninsula Tour. It has been voted the most beautiful garden in Africa.</p>

                        views.</p>
                    <p>Not just pretty to see, but at Cape Point, you can also visit the old lighthouse, board

                        across Africa, India, Indonesia and the Middle East, creating a new combination of 
                        culture.</p>
                    <p>Known for its brightly coloured houses, Bo-Kaap lies on the slopes of Signal Hill, just 
                        above the city centre, and is the epicentre of Cape Malay culture.</p>
